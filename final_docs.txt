Key Distinctions to Avoid Ambiguity

1. 194C vs. 194Q:
- 194C: For services or labor contracts involving work execution (e.g., construction, repairs, catering).
- 194Q: For pure goods purchases (e.g., office equipment, photocopy machines).

2. 194JA vs. 194JB:
- 194JA: Technical services (not professional) and film-related royalties.
- 194JB: Professional services, non-compete fees, and non-film royalties.

3. When in Doubt:
194J acts as the fallback for professional or technical services that don’t clearly fall under 194JA or 194JB.
